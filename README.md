# Meeting-Attendance-with-Face-Recognition
Now a day all the meetings are online. This project helped to take note of all the attendees. Here I have modified it for screen capturing so you can work normally. 
All you need to do is install Python and then download this project then load command prompt in the folder and run "pip install requriement.txt".
Then you have to open the python file in a python editor. Edit the path with which all path ypu prefer. That is in sourceimg specify the path where you have kepth the photos of all the person you want to find." Note the the photos must be named after that person so that name will be loaded to attendance log". Then there is a pth in basic.py change it to where you want to create the attendance log.
