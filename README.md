# Meeting-Attendance-with-Face-Recognition
Now a day all the meetings are online. This project helped to take note of all the attendees. Here I have modified it for screen capturing so you can work normally. 
All you need to do is install Python and then download this project then load command prompt in the folder and run "pip install requriement.txt".
Then you have t run checkimg.py. then you will be prompted to enter location where the images of the people you want to recognize is placed. " Note the the photos must be named after that person so that name will be loaded to attendance log".Enter the path to the folder.
Then you will be prompted to enter location where you want to create the attendence log or you can directly edit basic.py and specify the path.
